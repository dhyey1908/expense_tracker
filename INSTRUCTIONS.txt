Hello,

Thank you for reviewing the MERN Stack Assignment submission.

Updates:
- The backend has been completely refactored to follow a strict MVC + Service architecture:
  - Controllers: Handle HTTP Request/Response only.
  - Services: Handle Business Logic and Validations.
  - Models: Handle Database Queries only.

Getting Started:
1. Unzip the "expense_tracker_code.zip" file.
2. Open the "expense_tracker" folder.

Database Setup (Queries):
- The SQL queries to create the Tables and insert dummy data are located in:
  /database/schema.sql
- Please import this file into your MySQL server to initialize the database "expense_tracker".

Project Setup:
- Please refer to the "README.md" file in the root directory.
- It contains detailed step-by-step instructions for installing dependencies and running the Backend and Frontend.

Screenshots:
- Screenshots demonstrating the 3 required statistics are located in the /screenshots folder.

Regards,
[Your Name]
